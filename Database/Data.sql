The streamer is coming out of the gate hot this summer with new original movies every week, and today marks the debut of actioner Gunpowder Milkshake. Directed by Navot Papushado, the film stars Gillan as Sam, a hardened assassin who suddenly turns her back on the organization that trained her when she takes a young girl (My Spy''s Chloe Coleman) under her wing and offers protection from the dangerous men who want to hurt her. Sam''s efforts to keep her newfound ward safe lead her back to the mother who abandoned her (Lena Headey) and her fellow assassins. Gunpowder Milkshake also stars Angela Bassett, Carla Gugino, Michelle Yeoh, and Paul Giamatti. Even ahead of the movie''s release, a Gunpowder Milkshake 2 has been put into early development, though details on that potential project are still slim. As of Wednesday morning, the movie is available to stream on Netflix. Tuesday night, ahead of its release, Gillan shared a new Gunpowder Milkshake poster on social media. The print is notable because it comes from Mondo, and it shows a stylized look at the movie''s diner fight scene. Though different from the aesthetics Netflix has chosen for Gunpowder Milkshake''s promotion, it still features bright colors and plenty of violence.

INSERT INTO News VALUES (3, N'Tom Hiddleston''s Loki Reportedly Returns In Doctor Strange 2', N'https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/loki-in-doctor-strange-2.jpg', N'After the season finale of Loki, it''s being reported that Tom Hiddleston will appear as the God of Mischief in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The Benedict Cumberbatch led sequel has been competing head-to-head with Spider-Man: No Way Home as the MCU''s most anticipated upcoming title. Little is known about either film, save for what can be gleaned from various comments from those involved on the projects. As for Doctor Strange 2, Elizabeth Olsen will be returning as Scarlet Witch after her Emmy nominated run in WandaVision, although it is unclear if she will be friend or for to the Sorcerer Supreme. Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams, and Chiwetel Ejiofor will also be reprising their MCU roles in the upcoming film as Wong, Christine Palmer, and Mordo, respectively. New to the Marvel realm will be Xochitl Gomez, who will be playing the Multiverse hopping America Chavez. Speculation runs rampant as to what the plot of Doctor Strange 2 could be, but WandaVision''s post-credits scene certainly seemed to hint that it will involve Wanda''s children. Now, Loki season 1''s finale also gave further clues as to the direction of the film. Hot on the heels of the highly anticipated finale, THR reports that Loki will be appearing in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Hiddleston will be reprising his role as the God of Mischief. Marvel has yet to confirm whether or not this is true, nor have any announcements been made concerning other characters from Loki that could potentially appear in the sequel.', N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Loki-Episode-6-Loki-and-Sylvie-With-Swords.jpg', N'It''s clear that Marvel has bigger plans for the God of Mischief - Loki season 2 was announced during the finale of the series, but there''s even more in store when it comes to his future. In a surprising turn of events, Jonathan Majors made a cameo in Loki after all. The actor may have denied rumors that he was appearing as Kang the Conqueror, but there was some truth to his words after all. Majors'' character in Loki is never referred to as Kang - rather, he is called He Who Remains, a version of the time-hopping villain. The events of the finale eventually lead to the breaking of the Sacred Timeline and this will likely be the entry point for Loki into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It was already reported that the series would lead directly into the Sorcerer Supreme''s next film, but no one could''ve guessed that it would have this direct of a link. It also seems to indicate that Kang could be the villain of the Doctor Strange sequel, or at least make an appearance in some capacity. Loki''s finale clearly has huge implications for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the MCU as a whole. Kang the Conqueror is clearly being set up as a major villain across a number of projects and it looks like Hiddleston''s Loki will be playing a huge role in these events as well.', GETDATE(), N'https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/loki-in-doctor-strange-2.jpg', 0)
INSERT INTO News VALUES (4, N'Suicide Squad 2 IMAX Poster Assembles the Whole Team', N'https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ss-1.jpg', N'An IMAX poster for The Suicide Squad assembles the film’s entire team. Following James Gunn’s firing from Disney for offensive tweets, Warner Bros. quickly swooped in to hire the Guardians of the Galaxy director, granting him free rein to work with any DC property of his choice. Gunn centered on a passion project, a film about DC’s covert paramilitary team of Belle Reve Penitentiary detainees organized by Amanda Waller and sent out on high-risk missions in exchange for shortened prison sentences. With David Ayer’s Suicide Squad having just been released in 2016, the relationship between the two films is naturally complicated. Other than a few returning characters like Viola Davis as Agent Waller, Gunn’s Suicide Squad doesn''t address or directly reference its predecessor in any way. Since it’s not a traditional sequel nor a full reboot either, the term soft reboot has caught on. While Task Force X was formed to stop Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) in the previous film, Gunn’s version will find the team of supervillains in the fictional South American country of Corto Maltese crossing paths with a giant telepathic starfish known as Starro. With the film’s release date coming up on August 6, tickets go on sale tomorrow, July 14, so The Suicide Squad has gotten a brand new IMAX poster that assembles Gunn’s version of Task Force X in its entirety. They are, from left to right: Savant (Michael Rooker), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Weasel (Sean Gunn), King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), Arm-Fall-Off-Boy (Nathan Fillion), Peacemaker (John Cena), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Javelin (Flula Borg), and Thinker (Peter Capaldi). Check out the full IMAX poster below: ', N'https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Suicide-Squad-IMAX-Poster.jpg', N'While The Suicide Squad will be getting a simultaneous release on HBO Max, this poster is the latest reminder that the film was tailor-made for IMAX. In a tweet sharing the poster, Gunn explains it was filmed entirely with IMAX cameras. Just as Rick Flag actor, Joel Kinnaman, previously discussed, The Suicide Squad is meant to be seen in theaters, especially since audiences are craving this communal experience in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. With theaters reopening across the United States, some in full capacity, the state of the domestic box office is looking promising. Godzilla vs. Kong was one of the first releases to test the waters and ended up having a successful run, and A Quiet Place Part II followed suit. F9 and Black Widow have helped restore a sense of normalcy for summer blockbusters, but reports indicate the US box office won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. With less than a month to go until its release, audiences have some time before flocking to theaters to see The Suicide Squad, which will surely be judged against this summer’s past releases, as well as its 2016 predecessor.',GETDATE(), N'https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ss-1.jpg', 0)

Directed by Jason Eisener, the Rutger Hauer-starring film first found life as one of the fake trailers included in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino''s Grindhouse double feature. The story centers on the titular vigilante arriving in the city of Hope Town and electing to exact violent justice on its crooked cops, pedophile Santas, and crime lord ruling over the town. Spawning from a Back to the Future short parody, creator Justin Roiland partnered with Dan Harmon to develop Rick and Morty for Adult Swim. Centered on mad scientist Rick Sanchez as he returns to his adult daughter''s life and drags his teenage grandson along for dangerous multiverse adventures, the series has been a smash hit for the network. The show has garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards and a sizeable 70-episode renewal order after its first three seasons. After a year of hiatus, season 5 has returned to very positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and Adult Swim is looking to keep the word rolling on the latest chapter of the series.', N'', N'', GETDATE(), N'https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Rick-and-Morty-Hobo-With-A-Shotgun-Promo.jpg', 0)
INSERT INTO News VALUES (2, N'Black Widow Director Explains Movie Ending’s Plot Hole', N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Black-Widow-Natasha-Romanoff-header.jpg', N'Black Widow director Cate Shortland explains the apparent plot hole at the end of the Marvel movie. Last weekend saw the long-awaited release of Black Widow, the first movie in the MCU''s Phase 4. Scarlett Johansson suits up for one final adventure as Natasha Romanoff, taking the assassin-turned-Avenger back to her roots. Black Widow picks up with Nat amid the events of Captain America: Civil War and sees her team up with her Russian spy family to take down the oppressive Red Room that trained her as a child. After the climactic battle at the Red Room, Natasha remains standing amid the wreckage of the once-floating fortress as Secretary Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) arrives on the scene. As Natasha is still on the run because of the situation with the Sokovia Accords from Civil War, one can assume Ross has every intention of arresting her. However, Black Widow cuts off before Ross gets there and jumps ahead two weeks, to when a blonde Natasha sets off to reunite with her fellow ex-Avengers. Some have questioned why Black Widow glossed over Natasha''s escape and have even deemed it a plot hole.', N'https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Black-Widow-Natasha-Mason.jpg', N'Natasha certainly has the skills to get out of sticky situations like the one at the end of Black Widow, so it really isn''t surprising that she actually managed to do so. Additionally, since fans know full well she eventually joins up with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and the other Secret Avengers, there wouldn''t be much tension in that moment had the movie shown her final moment with Ross. Shortland''s reasoning makes sense, though there may be some fans who aren''t satisfied by the lack of resolution on that point. Black Widow proper ends with Natasha heading off into the sunset, but the real last scene is tucked onto the end of the credits, per Marvel tradition. It confirms Natasha''s sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) has a bigger role to play in the MCU, and it will continue later this year with the Disney+ series Hawkeye. While audiences will see more of her, Black Widow is the end of the line for Johansson''s Natasha. As sad as it is to see her go, it''s perhaps fitting that the last scene she''s seen in has her leaving for a new adventure after using her skills to evade capture yet again. There''s a level of mysteriousness to it that''s absolutely perfect for a character as fascinating as Black Widow.', GETDATE(),  N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Black-Widow-Natasha-Romanoff-header.jpg', 0)
INSERT INTO News VALUES (3, N'Ryan Reynolds Shares New Images Wearing Deadpool’s Suit', N'https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Free-Guy-BTS-Ryan-Reynolds-Deadpool.jpg', N'Ryan Reynolds shares new images of himself wearing the Deadpool suit. It''s been a few years since the actor last reprised his comic book role via David Leitch''s Deadpool 2 from 2018. Since then, a lot has already happened, including the character now confirmed to be under Marvel Studios, with Deadpool 3 currently in the works. In the meantime, the actor has been busy with other ventures. That includes a brand new movie, Free Guy, where he reunites with Taika Waititi. The pair previously co-starred in Martin Campbell''s critically-panned Green Lantern movie, which both of them have joked about in the past. In their latest project together, Reynolds plays the titular character, Guy, while Waititi is the narrative''s main villain, Antoine. Given this, they teamed up in the new trailer for the project wherein they reprised their respective Marvel characters. Waititi appeared as Korg, the rock-creature from the Thor films, while Reynolds reprised Deadpool; in it, they pretend to react to the promo clip.', N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-5460.jpg', N'In early June 2021, Reynolds posted an image on his social media of Deadpool''s mask. Many perceived this either as something related to Deadpool 3 or figured he was just joking around. However, chances are that it had something to do with filming the latest Free Guy marketing clip. Impressively, the actor could''ve let someone else wear the costume since it''s only for a promo and then add his voice-over later on. This would''ve been easier; after all, Deadpool doesn''t remove his mask in the video anyway. But, chances are that Reynolds wanted to be as involved as he can in all aspects of the projects. In any case, he previously admitted to having fun with these promotional campaigns. It''s worth noting, however, that this video is likely not Marvel canon, so this is technically not Reynolds'' first outing as Deadpool in the MCU. Understandably, many could assume that since Korg is there too, but this is purely for Free Guy. As for when the Merc-With-A-Mouth finally debuts in the aforementioned franchise? It''s difficult to predict. At this point, Marvel Studios'' slate is stacked until at least 2023, with a mix of big and small screen projects in the pipeline. However, that doesn''t mean that Reynolds and his creative team aren''t already tinkering for potential narratives for the threequel.', GETDATE(),  N'https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Free-Guy-BTS-Ryan-Reynolds-Deadpool.jpg', 0)
INSERT INTO News VALUES (4, N'WandaVision Director Will Helm The Next Star Trek Movie', N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/USS-Enterprise-Star-Trek-Beyond.jpg', N'WandaVision director, Matt Shakman, is set to helm the next Star Trek film for Paramount Pictures. Shakman, a veteran television director, has worked on a number of various television series including Game of Thrones, It''s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Psych, just to name a few. He most recently directed all nine episodes of the Emmy nominated, WandaVision, for which he also was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthonology Series or Movies. Paramount Pictures has been looking to revive the Star Trek film franchise since 2016''s Star Trek Beyond underperformed at the box office. The originally announced planned the fourth film, which would have seen Chris Hemsworth reprise his role as Captain George Kirk and set to be directed by S.J. Clarkson, was scrapped. Quentin Tarantino had also talked about developing a new Star Trek film, but those talks seem to have fizzled out as the director is now considering retiring. Noah Hawley, the creator of Legion and Fargo, was set to write and direct a Star Trek film which eventually was shelved, and the creator has now moved onto another sci-fi property, Alien. Paramount still had plans for Star Trek and set a release date for June 9, 2023, which will arrive seven years after the release of Star Trek Beyond. According to Deadline, Matt Shakman has officially signed on to direct the next Star Trek film for Paramount Pictures and J.J Abrams'' Bad Robot, who produced the last three Star Trek films. Lindsey Beer (Sierra Burgess Is a Loser) and Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) are penning the script. There is no word yet on if the cast of the Kelvin era Star Trek films like Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, or Zoe Saldana will return to reprise their roles.', N'https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Marvels-Avengers-Heroes-Wanda-Vision.jpg', N'With no word on if the cast will return, it is uncertain if this will be a continuation of the story from Star Trek Beyond, and no reference has been made to it being the fourth film in the rebooted franchise. However, the presence of Bad Robot as the production company hints it could take place in the Kelvin timeline since the various television series like Star Trek Discovery and Star Trek Picard, which take place in the original series'' timeline, are not under the Bad Robot banner. This could indicate that the Star Trek film that Shakman has signed on for takes place in the Kelvin timeline, and it could be with an entirely new crew. Shakman continues an interesting trend that Paramount Pictures has taken with hiring directors for the latest Star Trek film. Like Shakman, formerly attached directors S.J. Clarkson and Noah Hawley are filmmakers who have primarily television backgrounds on prestige television series. This fits in with both the franchise history of being rooted in television, but also the fact that J.J Abrams kicked off the modern era of Star Trek and was primarily known as an accomplished television writer and producer. Shakman''s resume shows he can tackle a wide variety of projects, and Star Trek can be many different things depending on what the writer wishes. Booking the director of an Emmy nominated series to helm the next Star Trek film is a big win for Paramount and after WandaVision, audiences should expect something truly special.', GETDATE(),  N'https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/USS-Enterprise-Star-Trek-Beyond.jpg', 0)

Based on R.L. Stine''s book series by the same name, Netflix''s Fear Street is set across a trilogy composed of Fear Street Part One: 1994, Fear Street Part Two: 1978, and Fear Street Part Three: 1666. While the series was originally set to be acquired by Fox, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and Disney''s purchase of the studio, it ultimately landed at the streaming platform. Fear Street Part One: 1994 set up the story with the witch and her terrifying entities. The second entry is a prequel set at Camp Nightwing. A group of teenagers must work as a team if they hope to survive a possessed camp counselor looking to kill. Meanwhile, Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives finds iconic slasher, Jason Voorhees, accidentally resurrected. He heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, which has since been renamed to Camp Forest Green, to continue his spree of carnage that has taken place over the past several films in the franchise. However, Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) seeks to put an end to the terror. The Twitter account @NetflixFilm posted about the connections between Fear Street Part Two: 1978 and the Friday the 13th franchise. The Fear Street killer himself is noted as being strikingly similar to Voorhees from Friday the 13th Part 2 with the mask and type of silhouette. Additionally, the camp location that director Leigh Janiak filmed this sequel at is the same location that Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives was shot at.
